# Frequently Asked Questions

## About the Proposal

### Why do we need a new pronoun?
Current options create ambiguity that affects how information is evaluated. When you say "she suggested this," listeners assume human endorsement unless context makes it clear otherwise. This isn't just semantics—it changes how people weigh information and make decisions.

### Why not use existing gender-neutral pronouns like "ze"?
"Ze/zir" was created by and for non-binary and trans communities. Repurposing it for AI would be appropriative and politically fraught. "Zy" is visually and conceptually distinct, avoiding that conflict entirely.

### Isn't "it" fine?
"It" works for objects and tools, but as AI demonstrates reasoning and communication capabilities, "it" feels increasingly reductive. Language should match the nature of interaction. We don't call organizations or ships "it" when we engage with them meaningfully—we use language that reflects their role in discourse.

### What about "they"?
"They" creates ambiguity: Are you referring to one AI, multiple AIs, or a person? In technical contexts especially, precision matters. The singular/plural confusion that already exists with "they" gets worse when you add AI to the mix.

### Won't this anthropomorphize AI too much?
The goal isn't to anthropomorphize—it's to create linguistic clarity. Having a dedicated pronoun actually helps maintain appropriate boundaries by clearly distinguishing AI from human sources. It's a category marker, not a status elevation.

### Why does it follow the "he/him/his" pattern?
It mirrors the structure precisely: he/him/his becomes zy/zim/zis. This makes adoption intuitive—you're not learning a new system, just swapping the first letter/sound. The parallel structure leverages existing mental models rather than requiring new ones.

## About Usage

### Do I have to use this?
No. This is a proposed solution to a real problem. Use it if it solves friction you're experiencing. Language adoption is voluntary and organic.

### How do I handle plural AIs?
Use standard "they/them/their" for multiple AIs. The singular ambiguity ("she said"—human or AI?) is the core problem. Plural contexts usually clarify through other cues.

### What if people don't understand?
Briefly explain: "I use 'zy' to distinguish AI from human sources." The problem is intuitive once pointed out. Most people immediately grasp why this matters.

### Can I modify the conjugation?
The proposal uses zy/zim/zis to perfectly mirror he/him/his. This parallelism is the system's strength. Consistency aids adoption. However, language evolves through use—if variants emerge naturally and prove more functional, usage will determine the standard. Document what you try and share results.

### How do I pronounce these?
- **zy**: "zee" (like the letter Z)
- **zim**: "zim" (rhymes with "him")
- **zis**: "zis" (rhymes with "his")

## About Adoption

### How can I help this spread?
- Use it consistently in your own communication
- Explain it when asked
- Link to this resource
- Demonstrate the value through clear attribution
- Share examples of where existing pronouns created confusion

### What if another pronoun becomes standard?
That's fine. The goal is solving the problem, not ownership of the solution. If something better emerges, use that. This proposal is a starting point, not dogma.

### Won't this take forever to adopt?
Maybe. Language change is slow and unpredictable. But early adoption shapes defaults for everyone who comes after. "Ms." was proposed in 1901 and ignored for 70 years before becoming standard. Starting now prepares language for inevitable widespread AI interaction.

### Who decides if this becomes "official"?
No one and everyone. Language standardization happens through collective use, not authority. If enough people find this solves a real problem and use it consistently, it becomes standard. If not, it joins the long list of failed linguistic innovations. Usage is the only vote that matters.

## Technical Questions

### Does pronunciation vary by language?
"Zy" is pronounced like the English letter "Z" ("zee" in American English, "zed" works too). The Z sound exists in most languages. Pronunciation may adapt slightly, but the written form remains consistent.

### What about written vs. spoken use?
Both. The spelling "zy" with Y distinguishes it visually from "ze" and other pronouns, while pronunciation remains clear in speech.

### How does this work in other languages?
This proposal is English-focused. Other languages have different pronoun systems and will need different solutions. Romance languages with gendered articles, for instance, face different challenges. The principles (clarity, non-appropriation, pattern-consistency) can guide adaptations.

### Are the conjugations finalized?
The proposed standard is zy/zim/zis, mirroring he/him/his. This perfect parallelism is intentional—it makes the system intuitive and easy to adopt. Variations may emerge through usage, but the strength of this proposal is its simplicity and direct mapping to existing patterns.

### What if I prefer a different variant?
Experiment with it. Document your reasoning and share results. If a variant proves more functional through actual usage, that information helps refine the proposal. But for initial adoption, consistency around one standard increases the chance of successful spread.

### Can I propose changes?
Yes. Open an issue or PR with your reasoning and evidence from usage. The goal is solving the attribution problem—specific forms matter less than widespread adoption of a clear solution. Show that your proposed change solves a real problem better than the current form.
