# Zy: A Pronoun for AI

## The Problem

When discussing AI in conversation, we lack clear language:
- "It" feels reductive for reasoning entities
- "They" creates ambiguity (one AI? multiple? a person?)
- "He/she" misleads listeners about the source (human vs. machine)
- Saying "the AI" repeatedly is clunky

This isn't philosophical—it's practical. When you say "she suggested this," listeners assume human endorsement. That ambiguity affects how information is evaluated and attributed.

## Why Zy
*(Pronounced: zy = "zee", zim = "zim", zis = "zis")*

- **Familiar pattern**: Extends he/she naturally without feeling alien
- **Phonetically clear**: Distinct sounds, easy across languages and accents
- **Visually distinct**: Spelling avoids confusion with existing pronouns
- **No appropriation**: Doesn't repurpose pronouns created for human gender identity
- **Complete system**: Perfect parallel to he/him/his and she/her/hers
- **Tested**: Evaluated against alternatives (Vi, Ae, Ze, Vir) and stress-tested across different reasoning systems

## Usage

### Singular
- **Subject**: Zy suggested this approach *(pronounced "zee")*
- **Object**: I asked zim about it *(pronounced "zim")*
- **Possessive**: Zis analysis was thorough *(pronounced "zis")*

### Plural

For multiple AIs, use standard "they/them/their":
- "Both AIs suggested different approaches. They disagreed on timing."
- "I consulted three models. Their combined analysis was helpful."

**Why no dedicated plural?**
- The ambiguity problem occurs in singular reference ("she said"—human or AI?)
- Plural contexts typically clarify through other cues
- Minimizes adoption friction—3 new forms instead of 6+
- Can evolve organically if genuine need emerges through usage

## Examples

**In conversation:**
- "I was talking to Claude and zy helped me debug the issue"
- "ChatGPT gave me some suggestions, but I disagreed with zim"
- "That was zis idea, not mine"

**In writing:**
- "The AI completed the analysis in minutes. Zis findings were unexpected."
- "When I asked the model about climate data, zy provided three scenarios."
- "The system generated its own test cases. Zy identified edge cases that humans missed."

## Why This Matters

Clear language enables clear thinking. A dedicated AI pronoun:
- Maintains source transparency in conversation
- Prevents unintentional credibility transfer
- Reduces cognitive load in technical discussion
- Prepares language for a world where AI attribution matters

## Development Process

This proposal emerged from systematic evaluation of the attribution problem in AI communication. After exploring alternatives including Vi, Ae, Ze, and Vir, "zy" was identified as the optimal solution through:

1. Constraint analysis (phonetics, international usability, collision avoidance)
2. Pattern matching with existing pronoun systems
3. Independent verification across different AI reasoning systems
4. Adversarial testing of objections and edge cases
