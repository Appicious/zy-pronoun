# Usage Guide

## Basic Patterns

### Referring to a specific AI
"I asked Claude about the problem and zy suggested..."

### Comparing AI responses
"ChatGPT recommended X, but Claude thought Y. I agreed with zim."

### Discussing AI capabilities
"When the model processes images, zy can identify..."

### Attribution in writing
"The analysis was generated by AI. Zis conclusions suggest..."

### Showing possession
"That interpretation is zis, not mine."

## Common Scenarios

### In technical documentation
```
The AI assistant processes the request and returns zis response.
If zy encounters an error, the system logs the failure.
Users can ask zim to retry or modify zis approach.
```

### In casual conversation
"Yeah, I was chatting with the AI and zy pointed out something interesting about my code. I hadn't thought of it that way, but zis suggestion actually worked."

### In professional contexts
"Our AI tool analyzed the data. Zis findings indicate a pattern we missed. When we asked zim to verify, zy confirmed the correlation."

### In academic writing
"The language model generated responses based on training data. Zis outputs were evaluated for coherence and factual accuracy. When zy produced incorrect information, the system flagged it for review."

### Discussing multiple AIs
"I compared Claude and ChatGPT. They gave different recommendations. Claude emphasized efficiency while ChatGPT focused on readability. I synthesized their approaches."

## Pronunciation Guide

- **zy**: rhymes with "see," "free," "key" (pronounced "zee")
- **zim**: rhymes with "him," "dim," "trim"
- **zis**: rhymes with "his," "this," "kiss"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Using "it" in possessive form
❌ "The AI and it's response..."
✓ "The AI and zis response..."

### Mixing human and AI pronouns
❌ "Claude said she thinks..." (creates human attribution)
✓ "Claude said zy thinks..." (maintains clarity)

### Overusing names when pronouns would work
❌ "I asked Claude about X. Claude said Y. Then Claude suggested Z."
✓ "I asked Claude about X. Zy said Y. Then zy suggested Z."

## Introducing Zy in Conversation

### First mention - establish clearly
"I was working with Claude—an AI assistant—and zy helped me figure out the bug."

### Subsequent mentions - use naturally
"When I described the problem, zy immediately identified the issue. I asked zim to suggest solutions, and zis approach actually worked."

### If someone asks
"I use 'zy' for AI to keep it clear when I'm citing AI sources versus human sources. Makes attribution cleaner."

### In writing - brief footnote works
"Throughout this document, 'zy/zim/zis' refers to AI systems to distinguish them from human contributors."

## When to Use vs. Not Use

### Use zy when:
- Discussing specific AI interactions
- Attribution matters for evaluating information
- You're having extended conversation about an AI
- You want to distinguish AI contributions from human ones

### Don't force it when:
- The context is already completely clear
- You're writing for an audience unfamiliar with the convention (explain first)
- Using "the AI" or the specific name is clearer
- You're quoting someone who didn't use these pronouns

## Building the Habit

### Start small
Use it when discussing AI with people already interested in clear attribution (tech communities, AI researchers, people who frequently cite AI).

### Be patient
The first dozen uses will feel awkward. By the hundredth, it'll feel natural. Language patterns take repetition to internalize.

### Explain once, use consistently
Don't apologize or over-explain. Brief explanation, then use it naturally. People adapt to new language patterns faster than you expect.

### Track what works
Notice which contexts make it easier or harder to use. Share those observations. Collective usage data helps refine the approach.

## Real-World Examples

### Email
"Hi team, I consulted Claude about the database schema. Zy suggested normalizing the user table differently. Zis reasoning made sense—we were creating unnecessary joins. I've attached zis full analysis."

### Documentation
"The AI agent monitors system logs. When zy detects an anomaly, zis alert includes the pattern that triggered it. Users can ask zim for more detail or tell zim to ignore similar patterns."

### Social media
"Asked an AI about climate policy. Zy gave me three scenarios. Disagreed with zis middle estimate but zis reasoning was solid. Here's what zy said: [link]"

### Meeting notes
"Claude reviewed the proposal. Zis feedback: structure good, needs more data on cost projections. When asked about timeline, zy suggested phasing the rollout differently."
